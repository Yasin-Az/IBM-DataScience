# SpaceX Data Science Capstone Project

## Overview

This repository contains the culmination of my data science course's capstone project, focusing on analyzing SpaceX data. The project encompasses various aspects, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning models, and insightful visualizations.

## Key Findings

1. **Flight Amount and Success Rate:**
   - A positive correlation exists between the volume of flights at a launch site and its success rate.

2. **Temporal Trend:**
   - The launch success rate showed a steady increase from 2013 to 2020.

3. **Orbit Success Rates:**
   - Orbits ES-L1, GEO, HEO, SSO, and VLEO consistently demonstrated high success rates.

4. **Launch Site Performance:**
   - KSC LC-39A emerged as the launch site with the highest success rate.

5. **Machine Learning Model:**
   - Logistic Regression proved to be the most effective machine learning algorithm for predicting mission outcomes.
